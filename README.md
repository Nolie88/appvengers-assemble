## User Story:

- AS A movie buff

- I WANT to search movies and recieve a list of movies matching that title. I want to be able to save them locally and easily view the movie trailer

- SO THAT I have a database that I can easily access information on my favourite/recently watched movies


## Description: 
HollyView is a site in which a user can collate a locally saved list of their recently watched and favourite movies.
HollyView pulls the selected movie’s information from OMDB’s API database, and displays it in a way that the user can easily access the movie’s title, synposis, and genre. 
The user will also have the option to view the movie's trailer at the click of a button, using YouTube's API.

When the user adds a new movie to their favourites, this will then be the first displayed movie on the information cards. The user will be able to access a list of all movies they have added to their favourites over time.


## Usage:
HollyView allows users to browse OMDB's large database of movies via a simple search which returns all related titles. 
From there, the user has the option to see More Info on the movie, or add it to favourites
When the 'More Info' button is clicked, the user will be taken to a page that shows the movie poster, title, synopsis, genre's, and an 'Add to Favourites' button
When the user clicks the 'Add to Favourites' button, either from the home page or the more info page, the movie is saved into the users local storage, and it is then displayed on the 'Favourites' page. 
The user can use HollyView to collate a collection of their favourite movies.
